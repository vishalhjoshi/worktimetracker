**Created On:** 2025-06-23
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Overview
A minimalist time tracking application that allows a user to authenticate, login/logout for work sessions, and track their productive and gross hours. Inspired by Keka, but tailored for solo developers or small teams.

## 2. Goals
- Allow a user to authenticate securely.
- Enable tracking of productive time (time between login and logout).
- Display daily, monthly, and yearly reports.
- Keep it simple and focused on solo developer needs.

## 3. User Stories
### üßë‚Äçüíª Authentication
- As a user, I want to sign up and log in securely using email and password.

### ‚è± Work Time Tracking
- As a user, I want to "login to work" to start time tracking.
- As a user, I want to "logout from work" to stop time tracking.
- As a user, I want to see the duration of my current or last session.

### üìä Reporting
- As a user, I want to see a daily report of work time (date, start, end, total duration).
- As a user, I want to see a monthly summary of total hours worked.
- As a user, I want to see a yearly summary of total hours worked and average productivity.

## 4. Functional Requirements

  email: string
  passwordHash: string
  createdAt: Date
}

}
```

# Updated Project Scope: WorkTimeTrack V1

## 1. Tech Stack Confirmation
- **Frontend & Backend:** Next.js (App Router preferred) with full-stack capabilities (API routes).
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui components ‚Äì ‚úÖ sufficient.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (hosted via Neon).

## 2. Authentication
- ‚úÖ Use JWT-based authentication for session management (via cookies or localStorage).
- ‚ùå Email verification is out of scope for V1 ‚Äì skip for now.
- ‚úÖ Basic user signup/login/logout with secure password hashing.

## 3. UI/UX
- ‚úÖ Multi-page flow is acceptable (e.g., Login ‚Üí Dashboard ‚Üí Reports).
- ‚úÖ Minimal but clean UI with TailwindCSS + shadcn.

## 4. Reporting
- ‚úÖ Fixed views:
  - Daily (with per-session breakdown)
  - Monthly (day-wise total)
  - Yearly (month-wise summary)
- ‚ùì Filtering by date range ‚Äì Optional, but could be a nice-to-have even in V1 if it's easy with SQL.
- ‚ùå CSV export can be deferred to V2.

## 5. User Management
- ‚úÖ Support multiple users:
  - Each user sees only their own data.
  - No admin panel/team management needed in V1.

## 6. Deployment
- ‚úÖ Local development is sufficient for now.
- Cloud deployment (Vercel + Neon) can be added once MVP is tested.

## 7. Password Reset
- ‚úÖ Just a local password reset (like "Change Password" from within the account settings).
- ‚ùå No email-based forgot/reset password flow for now.
